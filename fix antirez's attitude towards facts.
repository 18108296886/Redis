An issue was made regarding Redis's decision to spend a year mostly on replication while ignoring simple and basic options there have been requested for 5 years.

Antirez made a respond saying he wanted to create a software for "smart people" and don't care if others suffered, then a long response backed by facts was made to Antirez's response, which he promptly deleted.

Github was showing 404 after Antirez deleted the issue (#2325), but after a few refresh, an unflushed github cache shown up and was captured.

Here is a backup:
